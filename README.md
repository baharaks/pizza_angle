Overview
This project is a comprehensive PyTorch-based framework designed for deep learning applications. It includes a set of Python scripts that facilitate the creation, training, and evaluation of neural network models. The framework is structured to provide a seamless experience from data handling to model training, with added utilities for improved functionality.

Contents
dataset.py: Manages data loading and preprocessing. This script is responsible for defining a PyTorch Dataset class that handles the loading of your dataset, applying transformations, and preparing it for training.

early_stop_pytorch.py: Implements an early stopping mechanism to prevent overfitting. This utility monitors a specified metric (e.g., validation loss) and halts the training process if the metric stops improving for a predefined number of epochs.

model.py: Contains the neural network architecture. This script defines the Model class, where the layers and forward pass of your neural network are specified. It is where you would customize the architecture to fit your specific problem.

training.py: Orchestrates the training process. This script manages the training loop, including forward passes, loss calculation, backpropagation, and model updates. It also handles the evaluation of the model on the validation dataset.

utils.py: Provides additional utility functions that support the training process. These might include functions for metric calculation, result visualization, or data augmentation techniques.

Getting Started
Environment Setup: Ensure you have Python 3.6+ and PyTorch installed. You may also need additional libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib, depending on your specific use case.

Data Preparation: Place your dataset in an accessible directory and make any necessary adjustments to dataset.py to accommodate your data's structure and format.

Model Configuration: Customize the model.py script to define your neural network architecture. Adjust the layers, activation functions, and other parameters as needed.

Training: Run the training.py script to start training your model. You may need to adjust hyperparameters, the early stopping criteria, or other training settings in this script or in early_stop_pytorch.py.

Evaluation and Testing: After training, use the trained model to make predictions on new data. The training.py script typically includes evaluation on a validation set, and you can extend this to test datasets as well.
